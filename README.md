Summary:
This app facilitates blood donation by connecting donors directly with recipients in need. Upon signing up, users can opt to be donors, joining a pool of potential donors for future requests. Conversely, if they wish to opt-out, updating their status is a straightforward process. When a donor accepts a blood request from a user in need, the donor's information is automatically dispatched to the requesting user enabling private coordination for the final donation details.

Features:
1. Sign Up: The registration process allows users to create accounts securely, providing essential details such as email, password, name, blood type, and
contact information.

2. Log In: Users can log in securely using their registered email and password, with the system distinguishing between regular users and admin.
